["introduction.html", "1 Introduction 1.1 What is a garden path? 1.2 PP-attachment garden paths 1.3 An observation", " 1 Introduction Before the details of the current research can be outlined, it's first necessary to explain some of the terms and mechanisms involved. Most critically, it's necessary to be clear on what a garden path is, and what causes the phenomena. 1.1 What is a garden path? The occurrence of garden-path (GP) effects are generally attributed to a clash between structure-first parsing strategies, e.g. Frazier (1979)’s Minimal Attachment, and the actual intended structure of the sentence in question. Definition 1.1 (Minimal Attachment) Attach incoming material into the phrase-marker being constructed using the fewest nodes consistent with the well-formedness rules of the language under analysis (Frazier 1979) If we assume that the parser builds structure by following these types of constraints or rules in a programmatic way, without concern for meaning, it's easy to see how one might end up with a parse that denotes an implausible situation, or even an ungrammatical sentence. An example is the commonly studied garden path sentence, “The horse raced past the barn fell,” (Bever 1970). Here, the initial parse incorrectly assumes that the matrix subject is the unmodified NP the horse, per Minimal Attachment, and takes the matrix verb to be raced, as in the sentence, “The horse raced past the finish line.” The horse raced past the barn fell (Bever 1970) [S [NP The horse] [VP raced past the barn]]   ???   [VP fell] [S [NP The horse raced past the barn] [VP fell]] The attempted parse represented in structure (1) crashes, as it isn“t possible to incorporate the final word fell in a grammatical way. In order to obtain the grammatical parse, (1 b) where the matrix subject is the horse raced past the barn, almost the entire structure of (1 a) must be discarded. The subject is not the horse, and the main verb is not raced. Rather, the subject is a noun phrase (NP) containing a reduced relative clause raced past the barn. Only after remediation can fell be properly incorporated as the matrix verb. This finally results in a grammatical sentence, with a structure comparable to,”The horse (that was) raced past the barn was hungry.\" Garden-path effects can result any time the assumptions made by the parser clash with the actual structure of a sentence. 1.2 PP-attachment garden paths The type of garden-path sentence that this study is concerned with centers around the temporarily ambiguous attachment sites for a prepositional phrase (PP). Consider: He had planned to cram the paperwork [PP1 in the drawer] [PP2 into his briefcase]. He had planned to cram the paperwork [PP1 in the drawer] [PP2 of his filing cabinet]. The sentences in (2) and (3) contain a temporary ambiguity with regard to the attachment site of in the drawer (PP1). It can either attach high, as an argument of the verb (i.e., the paperwork is being crammed in the drawer), or else low, as a modifier of the direct object (i.e. the paperwork in the drawer is being crammed into his briefcase). Sentence (2) differs from (3) in the ultimate resolution of that ambiguity, although in both cases disambiguation is triggered by the preposition heading the second PP, PP2 (into/of). In (2), PP1 must ultimately attach high, as the locative argument of the verb, in order for a plausible parse to be obtained. This is likely to cause some difficulty for the reader or listener of the sentence, if structure-first parsing strategies like Minimal Attachment are obeyed. The parser will have attached PP1 as the verb\"s locative argument, not knowing PP2 was to come. The resulting parse crashes, because with PP1 attached high, PP2 has nowhere to attach but as a modifier of the noun in PP1 (*[NP the drawer into his briefcase]), or else as a modifier of the verb/sentence (*[VP he did so into his briefcase]). The preference for VP attachment of PP1 in these kinds of sentences is supported by experimental data in studies from Rayner, Carlson, and Frazier (1983), Clifton Jr, Speer, and Abney (1991) and Schutz and Gibson (1999). The other sentence, (3), should not represent any difficulty. The ambiguity is resolved such that PP1 can, and in fact must, attach high, since the subsequent PP of her filing cabinet (PP2) cannot plausibly attach as a sentential modifier, nor a verbal argument or modifier, and the sentence is incomplete without a destination of the cram action. By examining these sentences, the study proposed aims to expand understanding of human sentence processing in general, and specifically the relationship between syntactic structure and prosodic structure. Further, this will explore any contrast there might be in the impact of declarative and interrogative contexts on parsing, which has been under studied. 1.3 An observation These attachment ambiguities which are difficult to parse in the declarative, appear to be less difficult to parse when presented in yes-no interrogative context. Consider again the somewhat difficult to process sentence in (2), repeated below as (4) for convenience. He had planned to cram the paperwork [PP1 in the drawer] [PP2 into his briefcase]. The mechanics of this garden path are discussed in section . The point to consider here is that, according to the intuition of many native speakers of American English, the difficulty of (4) is at least somewhat lessened in (5): Had he planned to cram the paperwork [PP1 in the drawer] [PP2 into his briefcase]? That is, while both sentences contain a temporary ambiguity for the attachment of PPs occurring in string-linear sequence at the end of an utterance, it is more likely in (5) that a listener or reader will come away with a plausible interpretation. This study explores the factors involved in why that is, and seeks to uncover a behavioral correlate of this intuition. If the existence and mechanics of this effect can be pinned down, it will lend insight into what information the parser has access to when making decisions, or when repairing broken parses. This initial observation reveals a robust program of research with many interwoven questions. One of the many questions is: can speaker behavior be shown to reflect the intuition? To say it another way, is there some behavior that is correlated with the reduction in difficulty of parsing PP-attachment garden paths that can be measured? Peckenpaugh (2016) represents one attempt to find such a correlate, and this paper continues that search. One might also ask what property or properties of polar questions might lead to an easier parsing of garden paths, or at least to the perception that they are easier to parse as polar questions than as declaratives. Because there are minimal differences between the polar question and declarative version of a given sentence, it is fairly easy to assume that the cause lies in one of two domains: the prosodic changes triggered by the use of question intonation, or the pragmatic and semantic properties that are not shared across the versions. An obvious reflex of the former possibility is another question: how are the various versions of these sentences actually pronounced? This question is deceptively difficult to answer; the reported study seeks to answer it, but while the recordings collected provide some insight, more work is likely needed to satisfactorily provide an answer. Likewise, the latter possibility leads one to wonder: what are the semantic and pragmatic differences between a polar question and its declarative counterpart? This question can be approach in a more theoretical way, and has been to some degree in the literature. That said, it remains to be determined how those properties could lead to an easier parsing process, and whether or not a satisfactory explanation for the intuition at large can be pulled from these differences.

["background.html", "2 Background 2.1 Can prosody affect parsing? 2.2 Prosody in silent reading 2.3 Prosody of questions vs. declaratives 2.4 Syntactic structure of PP-attachment ambiguities 2.5 Predictions for the current study", " 2 Background This section goes over evidence supporting the claim that prosody can impact parsing decisions, even in silent reading. 2.1 Can prosody affect parsing? A number of studies have shown that in listening to speech, prosodic cues appear to help reduce the frequency with which incorrect parsing (i.e. a garden path) occurs. For example, Kjelgaard and Speer (1999) conducted a study using digital manipulation of recorded speech to create three versions of sentences containing a garden path temporary ambiguity (discussed above). They recorded speakers saying sentences with natural prosody, such as the following pair: [When Roger leaves] the house is dark. (Early closure) [When Roger leaves the house] it's dark. (Late closure) They then cross-spliced these together to make several versions. One version had prosodic cues which cooperated with the intended reading of the sentence; another attempted to have “neutral” prosody; and the third used intentionally misleading prosody. The initial fragment of each was then presented to participants (the portion from the beginning of the sentence to the word house in (6 - 7) and they were asked to agree or disagree with whether a visually presented word, either is or it's was likely to be the next word in the sentence. Participants gave more accurate and speedier judgements when the prosodic cues lined up with the correct parsing. The results of this study, as well as a growing body of literature, suggest that that prosodic information can (or perhaps must) be used by the parser in making processing decisions. 2.2 Prosody in silent reading The experiment presented in this paper is conducted using silent reading, and it is perhaps less intuitive to assume that prosody might play a role in the processing of silent reading compared to the processing of spoken utterances. Nonetheless, there is some evidence to support such an effect; as such, a positive result here is not a reason to dismiss the prosodic explanation for the effect, although it also can't support that explanation over others. Consider Fodor (2002) analysis of relative clause attachment preference. This concerns sentences such as (8): Someone shot the servantN1 of the actressN2 [RC who was on the balcony]. The relative clause (RC) who was on the balcony can attach either locally (low, modifying N2), making it the actress who was on the balcony, or higher up (non-locally, modifying N1), so that we understand the servant to be the one who was on the balcony. In these sorts of sentences, Cuetos and Mitchell (1988) found a 60% preference for low attachment in English speakers, but only a 40% preference for low attachment in Spanish speakers. In apparent violation of the general preference for local attachment, recall Minimal Attachment (1.1), from Frazier (1979), some languages, like French and Spanish (and Russian, but not Romanian or Brazilian Portuguese, so this is not a general feature of Romance languages), prefer to attach relative clauses higher, while others more often obey Late Closure (e.g., Swedish, Egyptian Arabic, and English). This non-local preference is weakened in cases where the ambiguous RC is short (one prosodic word). Fodor (2002) asserts that these tendencies exist in both listening to spoken words (under conditions where a particular parse is not favored by the explicit prosody) and in silent reading. Fodor notes that other researchers have shown the presence and absence of prosodic breaks to influence parsing decisions, and specifically that the presence of a prosodic break before the RC in sentences like (5) encourages high attachment. Fodor leverages this in order to explain the difference in RC attachment site tendency between languages. She argues that the phenomenon can be neatly account for by linking attachment site preference to the likelihood of a prosodic break before the RC. This difference in prosodic tendency, in turn, can be explained using a constraints-based approach. Consider Selkirk's (1986) alignment constraints: Definition 2.1 (Generalised Alignment) Align(\\(\\alpha\\)Cat, E; \\(\\beta\\)Cat, E) Align (GCat, E; PCat, E) Align (PCat, E; GCat, E) Align (PCat, E; PCat, E) GCat ranges over morphological and syntactic categories; PCat ranges over prosodic categories; E = Right or Left (Selkirk 1986, 6) Truckenbrodt (1999) provides a prose-based formalization of the same idea. He describes what I will call AlignR which can be easily generalized to described what I will call AlignL, the same constraint except that it calls for aligning phrases at their left edges rather than their right edges. Align-XP/R For each XP there is a PP such that the right edge of the XP coincides with the right edge of the PP, where XP is a maximal projection and PP is a Phonological Phrase. This constraint represents the end based mapping assumption for Major Phonological Phrases in English, whose right end is supposed to align with the right end of Maximal Projections (Truckenbrodt 1999, 223). Essentially, Selkirk argues that relative ranking of alignment constraints for the left edge of phrases (AlignL) with those for the right edge of phrases (AlignR) can impact the distribution of prosodic breaks. These alignment constraints dictate that the edges of prosodic units (and thus the location of prosodic breaks) should align with the edges of syntactic constituents. Because the prosodic break that encourages high attachment is one which aligns with the left edge of the RC, postulating that AlignL is ranked above AlignR in languages like French that prefer high attachment can account for that preference (remember that a prosodic break in that place has been shown to encourage a high attachment interpretation). In languages where low attachment is preferred, we can assume that AlignR is ranked higher, and thus a prosodic break is more likely to occur after the RC than before. The same sort of argument can explain the difference in tendency between long and short RCs. Consider Selkirk's (2011) BinMin defined below. BinMin(\\(\\phi\\)) A \\(\\phi\\) (phonological phrase) must consist of at least two \\(\\omega\\) (phonological words). If we assume, in Optimality Theoretic (Prince &amp; Smolensky, 1993) terms, that a constraint like BinMin is ranked above AlignL, then it seems quite reasonable to assume that a prosodic break before a short RC (which would encourage high attachment) is much less likely than before a long RC. That is, when the RC is short, its left edge is prevented from aligning with the beginning of a prosodic phrase (it violates AlignL) by the higher ranked BinMin. Longer RCs can have their left edge align with the start of a prosodic phrase, and thus can have the high-attachment encouraging prosodic break. This analysis, of course, assumes the presence of prosodic cues, which are only overtly present in spoken utterances (punctuation aside). Given the elegance and explanatory power of this analysis, it seems reasonable to at least consider the further assumption necessary for it to also explain the phenomenon as it occurs in silent reading; which is that readers project prosodic structure over sentences even when they are read silently. 2.3 Prosody of questions vs. declaratives In pursuing the possibility that it is the intonation and prosody of polar interrogatives which creates the intuitive contrast that this study investigates, we must consider what question intonation actually sounds like. It is generally agreed that in American English, the intonation of a polar (yes/no) question has the property of a final rise. Indeed, this has been confirmed in corpus studies such as Hedberg, Sosa, and Görgülü (2017) who found that 79.8% of the 410 American English yes/no questions in their study (ten-minute phone conversations from the CallHome Corpus of American English and the Fisher English Corpus) had a “low-rise nuclear contour” (L*H-H%, L*H-↑H%, or L*L-H%)1. To briefly explain their ToBI notation, a tone T is either L for low or H for high; T* is anchored to the stressed syllable, and T- and T% are boundary tones (intermediate phrase boundary and intonational phrase boundary respectively). See, e.g., Guidleines for ToBI labeling (Beckman and Ayers 1997) for a more thorough explanation of ToBI. An additional 10.7% of the Hedberg, Sosa, and Görgülü (2017) data had a “high-rise nuclear contour” (the authors categorizes the following tunes as “high-rise nuclear contours:” H*H-H%, or !H*L-L%). That leaves only 9.5% spread across the other 5 categories (High-fall, Rise-fall, Low-fall, Fall-rise, and Level). Only 5.6% of the data showed a falling contour. According to the authors' analyses, these contours occur on the final main stress of a sentence and thereafter. In the case of the types of sentences examined in the current study,that would result in a rising contour on the head noun of the final PP. Did Jed cram the newspapers under the sofa in the [L*H-H% guestroom]. The need to prepare for that rising tone might make a prosodic break before the PP more likely, and thus ease reanalysis or even encourage a different prosodic chunking which might encourage high attachment. A brief informal survey found that most speakers maintain low tones on prior stresses, although some had a H tone on the subject noun. It also varied between speakers and between sentences as to whether there is a prosodic boundary (marked by a low tone and/or pause) immediately before the rise (after PP1) or not. The prosodic structures found in the data collected for the current study are discussed in 4.2. 2.4 Syntactic structure of PP-attachment ambiguities As discussed in the introduction, this study is focused on the impact of sentence type (interrogative vs. declarative) in a particular sort of garden path. Specifically, it is concerned with garden path sentences containing a temporary ambiguity that centers on the attachment of prepositional phrases (PPs) occurring in string-linear sequence at the end of an utterance, e.g., “When he saw her, the nanny had seated the cranky little boy [PP1 on the swing] [PP2 in his stroller].” Consider (13): Jed crammed the newspapers under the sofa in the trashcan. # … [VP crammed [NP the newspapers] [PP1 under [NP the sofa [PP2 in the trashcan]]] … [VP crammed [NP the newspapers [PP1 under [NP the sofa ]] [PP2 in the trashcan]] In the case of this sort of garden path, Minimal Attachment, or some variation thereof, results in a structure where the first PP attaches to the verb phrase (VP) as an argument, i.e. [VP V NP PP1], which leaves nowhere for the second PP to attach but as a modifier of the noun phrase (NP) inside PP1 (##[PP1 on [NP the swing [PP2 in his stroller]]]). This initial parse (12~ ~a) is pragmatically implausible, as one does not generally find swings inside strollers. Reanalysis is required to bring about the correct parse (12~ ~b), where PP1 attaches as an NP modifier of the direct object [VP V [NP N PP1] …] which allows PP2 to attach as a VP argument, i.e. it is the cranky little boy on the swing who is being placed in the stroller. Note that Minimal Attachment as defined by Frazier (1979) is somewhat at odds with modern syntactic theory (cf. Chomsky 1995, p. 62). As originally postulated, it relies on a verb with multiple internal arguments incorporating each of those arguments as a sister (i.e. a ternary branching structure: [VP V NP PP]). With more modern theories where binary branching is obligatory, it becomes less clear that the VP attachment site for PP1 actually creates fewer nodes than the lower NP attachment site. Nonetheless, the preference for VP attachment in these kinds of sentences is there, be it due to Minimal Attachment, a preference for arguments over non-arguments, or whatever else: see evidence from e.g. Rayner et al. (1983) and Clifton et al. (1991). I assume, following Frazier (1998) that it can be adequately described by reformulating Minimal Attachment to include a preference for argument relations over non-argument ones, or else through careful consideration of the syntactic structures involved and reformulation of Minimal Attachment. The precise definition of this parsing strategy is not a concern of this paper, but it is assumed to be at play. 2.5 Predictions for the current study This study is concerned with a number of issues. First: is attachment in any way encoded in the speech signal? I hypothesize, following e.g. Schafer et al. (2000), that we can use prosody to diagnose attachment site. Assume the following basic configuration: SUBJ V OBJ PP1 PP2 I suggest that high attachment of PP2 will be marked by a prosodic boundary between PP1 and PP2 (for discussion of what constitutes a prosodic boundary, see Streeter, 1978 and Salverda et al., 2003). Low attachment of PP2, on the other hand, will lack any substantial boundary marking. *Question for Di:* (@hypa - @hype) are the hypothesis I wrote before running the study, but they are not all really answered by the data I got. Is it dishonest to omit or revise them for this paper? Hypothesis 1 High attachment of PP2 is prosodically marked by a boundary tone between PP1 and and PP2. The second issue: what factors impact immediate on-line parsing, and what factors only affect later, post-parse considerations? To address this, the study will employ the double reading paradigm of Fodor et al. (2018) (more on double reading in the methods section). For example, if first-pass parsing ignores semantic information, then implausible parses should be more frequent in cold readings (i.e. without preview) of a garden-path sentence than in a second reading of the same sentence. Hypothesis 2 A cold reading (no preview) of a GP sentence will exhibit less natural prosody (more hesitation at and after the disambiguating region) than: A cold reading of a non-GP sentence. A previewed reading of a GP sentence. Hypothesis 2 and 3 together make a third prediction: readers should struggle more on the cold reading of a GP sentence to obtain a plausible structure, and thus the appropriate prosody, than on a previewed reading. Hypothesis 3 A cold reading of a garden-path sentence will more often be produced with prosodic structure that represents an implausible or ungrammatical parse of the string (low attachment of PP2), whereas a previewed reading sentence will more often be pronounced with the prosodic structure that represents the intended parse (high attachment of PP2). Note that hypothesis 3 can’t be applied in cases where the reader fails to successfully and fluently produce the sentence (which may sometimes happen, due to the GP effect). Finally, I investigate an intuition originally discovered by Janet Dean Fodor and Dianne Bradley: that these GP sentences are not as difficult to parse when encountered in interrogative, as opposed to declarative, context. Hypothesis 4 A cold reading (no preview) of a declarative GP sentence will exhibit less natural prosody (more hesitation at and after the disambiguating region) and be more likely to be produced with prosodic structure that represents an implausible or ungrammatical parse of the string than a cold reading of an interrogative GP sentence. In section I discuss to what extent these hypotheses are borne out. Hedberg, Sosa, and Görgülü (2017) use ↑ to indicate an upstep, which is not standardly transcribed with ToBI.↩ "],

The methodology outlined is referred to as the Double Reading Procedure and was first implemented by Fodor et al. (2019). Participants are asked to read sentences twice, once without any previewed (Reading 1), and then again after unlimited preview (Reading 2). 3.1 A note on the Double Reading Procedure An advantage that the Double Reading Procedure has is that it allows for certain assumptions to be made about Reading 2 that otherwise would be unclear: Reading 2 represents a considered reading of the sentence. Not only has the reader had ample time to examine the sentence, they have necessarily read it, and they have heard themselves read it. We can say this with certainly, because they have necessarily already produce a recording of Reading 1. This means Reading 2 represents a considered prosodic structure, and it should not represent any processing issues, because a parse should have already been obtained during Reading 1. The nature of Reading 1 is less clear. Because there is variability in the delay between the display of the sentence and the onset of phonation, it’s possible that Reading 1 is not entirely non-previewed. The properties of these Reading 1 delays are discussed at length in , but for now it suffices to say that the amount of preview that is possible during a delay that typically falls in the 0.6s to 1.6s range is very limited. As an example of common reading rates, Ashby et al. (2012) reported faster readers as averaging 328 words per minute (wpm), and slower readers 228wpm in silent reading with 3 word windows allowing for parafoveal processing. That study found that reading time is slower for reading aloud, and that the availability of parafoveal information (i.e. the difference between 1 word and 3 word windows) is less impactful for that reading mode. For reading aloud, faster readers were slowed to an average of 213wpm, and slower readers to an average of 183wpm with 3 word windows. We can say about Reading 1, at the very least, that a full parse of the sentence is not possible during the time before phonation begins, even delays in the 1.6s range. The utterance of Reading 1 should contain within it any behavioral reflex of whatever parsing difficult the reader has. 3.2 Participants recruitment The participants in this study were all undergraduate students at Queens College, CUNY, enrolled in Psychology 101. These students were required by the university to participant in studies for course credit. Self reported age ranged from 18 to 25 years. Participants were recruited using the Queens College Sona system, which is software designed for university participant pools. Students saw a notice on the Sona website (see Appendix ) and were able to schedule their own appointment time within the hours offered (Monday - Thursday, 10am to 4pm). All participants were self identified native and primary speakers of American English. One participant was disqualified post-hoc after producing a Caribbean English pronunciation pattern; one other participant was excluded post-hoc due to an extremely disfluent reading cadence. Both excluded participants were still awarded class credit for participating 3.3 Location All data were collected in a private room with only the experimenter and participant present. While every effort was undertaken to ensure a quiet environment, intrusive noise from passersby or neighboring rooms were sometimes unavoidable. This resulted in some unusable or partially unusable recordings (discussed in section 4.3 of the results chapter). 3.4 Equipment and software The experiment was presented on a laptop running Windows 10 with stickers on the keyboard labeling relevant keys. The left shift key was labeled START, right shift was labeled NEXT, and the touch-pad was labeled DONE. The presentation of items and instruction2 was done using the Open Sesame software (Mathôt, Schreij, and Theeuwes 2012) which provides a graphical user interface, scripting language, and interpretation of Python code, for precise control of experimental presentation. Recording was done using a Blue Yeti USB microphone position near the participant’s left hand and angled to point at the space in front of the participant’s mouth. The angle was adjusted for each participant’s height. It recording 44.1kHz single-channel audio. 3.5 Procedure Participants were given a verbal overview of the experimental procedure and then asked to read a one page printout of the procedure before signing a consent form. After signing a consent form, participants sat at the computer and were once again walked through instructions before the first practice item was presented. Participants sat at a computer and used keyboard button presses to navigate the experimental presentation. They received thorough instructions and completed three practice items, the consulted with the experimenter, before beginning the main portion of the study. The study also contained 4 pseudo-practice items that were not included in any analyses, in order to allow some time for the participant to settle into the procedure before any results were recorded. Each experimental item was preceded by a screen showing a line of ten Xes with its left edge aligned with the left edge of the to-be-revealed sentence. This was intended to fix the participant’s attention on the start of the sentence, and hopefully avoid unintended look-ahead. The issue of potential look-ahead is discussed at greater length in section This screen remained visible indefinitely, until the participant pressed START. Immediately after START was pressed, recording of the first reading began and the sentence appeared on the screen on a blue background. The recording continued and the screened remained visible until the participant pressed NEXT. After pressing NEXT, a screen appeared with instructions telling the participant that they were between readings, and needed to press START to reveal the sentence again and prepare for their second reading. Immediately after START was pressed, the first recording ended and the second recording began, and the sentence reappeared, this time on a green background. Procedure diagram The shifting of required key presses and the changing background color were intended to aid the participant in remember where they were in the process, and to prevent accidental double-presses of any given button from having unintended side effects. It took some time for the participants to adapt to the somewhat complicated procedure, but generally were well adjusted by the time the first item was presented. 3.5.1 On look-ahead As reported by Rayner et al. (2012), the perceptual span during reading is about 31 characters, or about 15 characters to either side, with an asymmetry favoring the direction in which reading occurs (i.e. wider to the right for English readers, wider to the left for Arabic readers) and a lack of importance of parafoveal information beyond the start of the fixated word in the direction of what has already been read (i.e. to the left in English). Rayner et al. show that at the extreme edges of this perceptual span, it appears to be only the presence and absence spaces that is shown to be available. Character shape (but not identity; e.g. whether a letter has ascenders or descenders) is available 10 characters to either side, With a fixation aligned with the left edge of a stimuli, focal attention is likely centered on the third or fourth character. The resulting potential for look ahead can be diagrammed as follows, assuming initial fixation on had, using a notation where a character whose identity can likely be extracted is reproduced, a character whose shape but not identity can be extracted is represented by an x, b, or j (depending on the shape of the original character, i.e. if the original character has an ascender, I’ve represented it with a b, if it has a descender I have represented it with a j, and if it has neither I’ve represented it with an x). Characters entirely outside of the perceptual span are represented with an x. Spaces are inserted only as far out as they could be identified, and otherwise filled with an x. XXXXXXXXXX (fixation slide) He had intendxb bx nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn He had intended to cram the paperwork in the drawer of his filing cabinet. Critically, the disambiguation PP2 region (in 18, of his filing cabinet) is not within the perceptual span until, at the earliest, one is in the object region (the paperwork). It is important to note as well, though, that when PP1, the phrase with ambiguous attachment site, is the fixation point, the existence of PP2 at least, is within the perceptual span. If we assume fixation on the, the available information should be something something like (19). nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn nnn nnjxxxxxb in the drawer xb bxnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn He had intended to cram the paperwork in the drawer of his filing cabinet. There is, therefore, the potential that look-ahead while reading PP1 could trigger the garden path effect of PP2 early, because it can be deduced that a short and then longer word are coming up on the periphery. The reader is likely to be aware as early as this point that something may be wrong with the parse that attaches PP1 as an argument of the verb, as that parse has limited available real-estate for further phrases. Another wrinkly involves the so-called eye-voice span (EVS). According to Laubrock and Kliegl (2015), when reading aloud, the voice is typically behind the eyes by 10-20 characters, varying with various properties of the text and different parts of the reading cycle. Thus, it’s difficult to know exactly where in the recording a reflex of the garden path would occur, but it is likely to be before the actually phonation of the disambiguating region. Most likely seems to be a hesitation in or around the previous phrase, i.e. PP1. This to some degree confounds the analysis of a pause after that phrase: it could be an intentional prosodic break, or it could be added processing time as a result of the reader discovering the garden path. This issue is revisited during discussion of the results. 3.6 Materials In total there were 16 experimental items in 4 versions each, and 32 fillers in two versions each. The design decisions are discussed in detail in this section. 3.6.1 Experimental items The goal in creating the experimental items was to have four versions of each item: a declarative garden path (D+GP), a declarative non-garden path (D-GP), an interrogative garden path (Q+GP) and an interrogative non-garden path (Q-GP). The experimental stimuli are based on earlier pilot study exploring this same phenomenon (Peckenpaugh 2016), but with several issues with that study’s experimental items corrected. The structure of the items are, schematically, something like (20). [Subject] [Verb-cluster: AUX + Matrix + Main] [Object] [PP1] [PP2] PP1 is always interpretable as either a modifier of the object NP or as the goal argument of the main verb; i.e. it is temporarily ambiguous. As a reminder, the running assumption is that the parser will initially assume PP1 to be the goal argument and attach it high (as an argument of the verb). For the +GP cases, PP2 will be incompatible with that structure and force reanalysis, so that PP1 attaches low as a modifier of the object and PP2 attaches high as the verbal argument. For the -GP cases, conversely, PP2 will be compatible with high attachment of PP1, i.e. will attach low as a modifier of PP1’s embedded NP. An example item in its four versions is provided in table 3.1. Table 3.1: Experimental item in four versions Version Sentence D-GP He had intended to cram the paperwork in the drawer of his filing cabinet. Q-GP Had he intended to cram the paperwork in the drawer of his filing cabinet? D+GP He had intended to cram the paperwork in the drawer into his boss’s desk. Q+GP Had he intended to cram the paperwork in the drawer into his boss’s desk? The reason for using a complex verb cluster (auxiliary + matrix + main) rather than a single verb has two parts. The purpose of the auxiliary is to eliminate differences across items: an interrogative version, +GP or -GP, is always identical to its declarative counterpart in every way, except for inversion of the order of the subject and auxiliary verb, and the replacement of a final period with a final question mark. If an auxiliary verb were not present, then the interrogatives would have an extra word, so-called do-support, that does not appear in the declarative (e.g. she put … vs. did she put …?). The auxiliary is always had and the past participle is always one of the following four: decided, intended, wanted, and planned. The purpose of the past participle matrix verbs is to partially alleviate the oddity of the yes/no questions. It seems quite odd to ask, “did she put the jelly beans in the window onto a fancy dish?” because, when it’s clear that the speaker already knows so much about the situation, it becomes difficult to imagine a pragmatically plausible context where the question would be asked. Such sentences might be described as “prosecutorial3.” Arguably, this is somewhat mitigated by the addition of a verb like decided: rather than asking about facts that we already seem to know, we are instead asking about the actor’s intention with regard to something that may or may not have taken place. Even if we know the facts of the situation, we do not necessarily know for instance whether it was the result of a decision, some third party’s action, or merely happenstance. Importantly, the main verb needs to be one which obligatorily takes a PP goal argument. One of these issues with the items from (Peckenpaugh 2016) was that the some of the verbs used only optionally took a goal4. Verbs that only optionally take a goal are likely to result in a parse where PP1 is not immediately incorporated as the goal argument, but rather be incorporated as a modifier of the object, which would mean that PP2 would not force reanalysis. Consider the contrasting sub-categorization of the verbs in (2122): Weak PP-argument sub-categorization (hide) The gangsters had hidden the shotguns in a U-Haul truck in an old outhouse. The gangsters had hidden the shotguns. Strong PP-argument sub-categorization (cram) Justin had crammed the old newspapers under the couch in a small wastebasket. * Justin had crammed the old newspapers. A verb like hide, as in (21), can take a goal, but is also able to do without one. A verb like cram, on the other hand, as in (22), really must have a goal. In designing the items for this study, only verbs that require a goal argument were used in order to maximize the likelihood of a robust garden path effect in the +GP versions, when PP2 triggers reanalysis. The four verbs used in this study were: cram, put, stick and set. Another important consideration was ensuring that the +GP versions had a PP2 which fully disambiguated the attachment site of PP1 such that reanalysis is forced. In (23), PP2 is implausible as a modifier of rocking horse, but strictly impossible, and the sentence is certainly grammatical with low attachment of PP2. On the other hand, the use of onto in (24) completely disallows the low attachment of PP2 at the syntactic level: a PP headed by onto simply cannot modify the preceding NP. She had decided to put the child [PP1 on the rocking horse] [PP2 on the see-saw]. She had decided to put the child [PP1 on the rocking horse] [PP2 onto the see-saw]. Where (Peckenpaugh 2016) relied on plausibility to force reanalysis, this study uses syntactic disambiguation, such that the +GP versions always have a PP2 headed by into or onto This avoids any discrepency between individuals’ belief of what is plausible from impacting the parse obtained. For the -GP items, the head preposition of PP2 was always either from or of (half and half, 8 each), which are compatible with a parse where PP1 is the goal argument and PP2 is modifying the NP within PP1. While from can be read as a goal argument, the assumptions made about how parsing works lead this to be an unlikely analysis, and of-headed PPs certainly cannot be a goal argument. It’s worth noting that some linguists believe of is not a preposition in the same sense as from, on, or in, etc. It’s also importantly only 2 characters, whereas into, onto, and from (the other possible heads of PP2) are all 4 characters. This is revisted and its impact is explored in the results section. The preposition that headed PP1 was always one which was compatable with a goal argument: in (8), on (7), and in one case, under. PP1 is the same across versions of a given item. 3.6.2 Fillers There were 32 filler items that ranged in complexity. Of these 32, 16 were designed to end in a sequence of two PPs, to mirror the experimental items (+PP). The other half contained no final PPs (-PP). All fillers were designed in two versions: declarative (D) and interrogative (Q). The +PP fillers were not related to the -PP fillers. He had forgotten to try the famous pastry in the restaurant of the fancy hotel. Had he forgotten to try the famous pastry in the restaurant of the fancy hotel? She had forgotten to report that the clerk was ignoring her request. Had she forgotten to report that the clerk was ignoring her request? A full list of fillers is available in appendix . Fillers were not limited to the four main verbs of the experimental item, but did always follow the same pattern of had followed by a past participle. The past participle was always one of the four used for experimental item (intended, decided, planned, and wanted), or one of these additional four: forgotten, remembered, meant, or needed, with each of the 8 past participles being used twice in the +PP fillers and twice in the -PP fillers, for a total of 4 times each. 3.6.3 Length Length was tightly controlled across items. For experimental items, all sentences were between 66 and 75 characters long, and between 13 and 15 words long. The length never varied across the ±Q condition. Across the ±GP condition there was a maximum length difference of one character. Two items varied in word length across ±GP by one word. For all length variations (word and character), an equal number were longer in the +GP condition as in the -GP condition. They ranged from 18 to 22 syllables. Control over filler length was slightly less stringent. They ranged from 63 to 79 characters and 12 to 14 words. 3.7 Experimental groups and order of items No participant saw more than one version of each sentence, and each participant saw one version of every sentence. Each participant saw the same number of each type of sentence: 4 garden path declaratives, 4 garden path interrogatives, 4 non-garden path declaratives and 4 non-garden path interrogatives. The experimental item were presented in pseudo-random order, interspersed with 1 to 3 fillers and with two experimental items never occurring in the same version twice in a row (e.g. after declarative garden path, the next experimental item was never also a declarative garden path). The four versions of the experimental sentences resulted in four groups. A split-half ordering (where the first 24 of the items presented to one group was the second 24 presented to the other) resulted in 2 versions for each group, and so there were 8 groups in total. 3.8 Inter-reading time (IRT) measurement Subjects were asked to read each sentence twice, once with no preview at all (reading 1, a cold reading), and then again after unlimited preview (reading 2, a previewed reading). Inter-reading time (IRT) is a measure of the amount of time between when a subject stops speaking after a cold reading and when they begin speaking for a previewed reading. IRT was measured using a Python script and Google’s WebRTC Voice Activity Detection (VAD) over 44.1kHz WAV files down-sampled to 8kHz via SOX5. This VAD system uses Gaussian Mixture Models to make probabilistic decisions on whether a given audio frame is speech or noise (see Falk and Chan (2006) for a complete explanation). Google’s implementation takes one parameter, which they call aggressiveness: a 4-tier setting for the level of confidence necessary to call a given frame speech. I call this “rejection rate”, where a higher rejection rate means that the model requires a high level of confidence before assuming a frame is speech, i.e. it is more likely to label something noise than speech. The implementation codes this setting as 0-3, where 0 is the most lenient (most likely to label a frame as speech) and 3 is the most stringent (most likely to label a frame as noise). The recordings vary in the volume of the speaker’s voice and the amount of background noise present. An algorithm was constructed to allow for the most stringent measurement of the least modified data that gave plausible measurements. Specifically, each file was measured using the highest possible rejection rate for the VAD algorithm and no modification of the file. If the timings detected were not plausible, the timings were re-measured with the same rejection rate, but after the recording had undergone a 200Hz high-pass filter6 (HPF). If that still failed, a 400Hz HPF was used. After a further failure, the rejection rate for the VAD was lowered, and the whole thing was tried again (0, 200Hz, 400Hz); and that process was itself repeated until the lowest possible rejection rate was tried of the four possible settings. A plausible set of measurements had to meet the following criteria: Utterance length: An utterance length between 2s and 10s, where utterance timing is the longest contiguous span in the recording that VAD reports as phonation, with breaks in phonation of less than 1s not breaking contiguity (Goldman-Eisler (1961) found that a large majority (82.5 to 87%) of pauses in fluent speech are less than 1s). Stimuli range from 18-22 syllables in length. If we assume a speech rate of 3 to 7 syllables per second (Jacewicz, Fox, and Wei 2010) we would expect utterances between 2.5s and 7.3s. Conservative thresholds higher and lower than the expected were used, especially on the higher end, to allow for any difficulties processing or fluency that might have lead to longer reading times. Minimum leading silence: A leading silence (“delay”) of more than 120ms. Even a very fast human reaction time should not permit a delay shorter than 120ms, so a shorter delay likely means something went wrong with the procedure and the participant is already speaking before the sentence is displayed. Maximum edge silence: A maximum trailing and leading silence length of less than 95% of the file’s length was also used, in order to filter out recordings that do not represent a valid trial. Very long silences less than this very conservative threshold that impact the IRT are dealt with in the data clean up rather than via phonation detection, as described in the results section of this paper (section ). With 32 participants reading 48 items (experimental and filler) twice each, there are an expected number of 3072 recordings; due to technical issues at the time of data collection, 71 recordings are missing. Of the 3001 recordings subjected to this treatment, 2976 resulted in plausible timings. For those that were successful, the breakdown of HPF and rejection rate used is reported in Table 3.2. A further 9 were set by hand, resulting in a total of 2985 recordings. Table 3.2: VAD rejection rate and high pass filter (HPF) values No HPF HPF at 200Hz HPF at 400Hz Lowest VAD rejection rate 0 0 1 … 2 0 1 … 392 37 0 Highest VAD rejection rate 1380 1159 4 3.8.1 Timing measurement reliability Timings were collected by hand for 768 recordings (25.6% of all data). Human measured timings were within 100ms of the VAD-measured timings in ??%7 of cases. 3.9 Prosodic judgments A trained linguist informant naive to the research being conducted listened to recordings and reported the presence or absence of breaks in certain regions of the sentence, as well as several other judgments. She was instructed to familiarize herself with a speaker’s speech patterns before rating any recordings by listening to 6 filler item recordings from that speaker. She was given a diagram of the sentences as in table , as well as full plain-text lists of all items. Table 3.3: Sentence region labels SUBJ V OBJ PP1 PP2 He had meant to stick ||\\(_{V}\\) the pencil case ||\\(_{OBJ}\\) in the cabinet ||\\(_{PP1}\\) into his book bag. NP\\(_{SUBJ}\\) AUX V\\(_1\\) V\\(_2\\) NP\\(_{OBJ}\\) PP\\(_1\\) PP\\(_2\\) She was asked to report on whether or not she heard a prosodic boundary directly after the region labeled V, directly after the region labeled OBJ, and directly after the region labeled PP1. The following definition of prosodic break was provided: Please work with the assumption that “prosodic boundary” in what follows is any subset of the following features, clustered in such a way as to trigger your intuition that a new prosodic element (of any size) is beginning: pitch change, volume change, segmental lengthening, or pause. The judgments requested also included whether or not the speaker struggled, where that struggle began, whether or not the speaker used question intonation, and which break(s) were stronger or more prominent than which other break(s). Detailed instructions on the order in which items should be listened to, both within speaker and across speakers, were also provided. The result was that she never listened to both readings of a sentence in sequence; she never listened to two reading 1 versions of different sentences in sequence; and she never listened to the sentences in the same order for a given participant as she did for the previous one. Details on the instructions given and the judgments collected can be found in the appendices (). 3.9.1 Reliability A second trained linguist repeated the task over 128 recordings selected from 8 participants (two from each group, one per ordering). Even number experimental items were used from 4 participants, and odd numbered from the other 4. There were 8 recordings missing from the 128 selected, so the reliability task resulted in judgments over 120 recordings. The first informant also blindly re-rated those 120, with the recording name obscured and instructions not to revisit her original ratings. Reliability scores (percent of recordings agreed upon) are reported in table . Table 3.4: Inter and intra-rater agreement with Cohen’s Kappa Breaks Break strength Struggle V OBJ PP1 STRONGEST WEAKEST STRUGGLED START REGION FINAL RISE Inter-rater 50.0% 65.0% 78.3% 54.2% 23.3% 85.0% 80.0% 95.8% K = 0.03 K = 0.17** K = 0.09 .

While the instructions to the rater requested full verbosity, it’s likely that inconsistencies occurred for these cases. The same inconsistencies would have hurt inter-rater agreement for strongest/weakest also. A further contributing issue for inter-rater agreement of those two judgments stems from the poor agreement on the presence of the verb break. When the raters do not agree about the presence of a break, that disagreement is magnified for the judgement of the relative strength of breaks. Instructions were also provided verbally and via printout.

["results.html", "4 Results 4.1 Participants in the reported analyses 4.2 Prosody 4.3 Inter-reading time (IRT) 4.4 Delay comparison for cold vs. previewed readings", " 4 Results This section reports various analyses of the recordings obtained. The analyses include the effect of sentence type (declarative vs. interrogative, garden path vs. non-garden path) on the location of prosodic breaks, as well as “study” or inter-reading time (IRT). In order to evaluate the extent to which participants followed the instruction to read immediately for reading 1 and then study the sentence for reading 2, the amount of time that a sentence is displayed before a participant begins to read it (delay) is also discussed and compared across reading 1 vs. reading 2. 4.1 Participants in the reported analyses There is a total of 32 participants included, 48 total items, 16 of which are experimental items, with each item read twice by each participant. The 32 filler items are not included in analyses except where specified. The same recordings are used for all analyses. Table 4.1: No. of participants per version-order combination Order 1 2 Sum Version 1 5 4 9 Version 2 4 4 8 Version 3 4 4 8 Version 4 2 5 7 Sum 15 17 32 There were 4 versions of the experiment, and two possible orderings, with approximately equal number of participants for each version-order combination. Ideally there would be 4 participants per version-order combination, but due to participant attrition and issues during data collection, the distribution is as in Table . Some items are missing due to technical issues during data collection. Data are also excluded if either recording from a pair of recordings (reading 1 or reading 2) is missing (there were 9 incomplete pairs excluded) because without the other member, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the participant followed instructions (i.e. did not study the sentence before reading 1, did study the sentence before reading 2). Recordings with no reported breaks are excluded from the prosodic analyses, since they are unlikely to represent the reader’s intended prosodic structure (there were 5 such recordings). The paired readings of these are not excluded, and IRTs extracted from them are included in the timing analyses, since delay information is available for both readings. Ultimately, 978 experimental item recordings are analyzed (489 pairs). The distribution of these recordings across the experimental item versions is shown in table . Table 4.2: Number of recordings by condition D Q -GP 246 247 +GP 245 240 If every items for each of the 32 participants had been available and included, the expected number per bin would be 2568. 4.2 Prosody This subsection presents the results of the independent rater’s judgements regarding prosodic boundaries. The sentences can be informally broken into regions as in (29). [SUBJ She] [VERBS had intended to set] [OBJ the clothes] OBJ [PP1 in the hamper] PP1 [PP2 onto the dresser]. In what follows, I will discuss prosodic breaks at the points directly after the direct object (referred to as OBJ) and directly after PP1 (referred to as PP1). 4.2.0.1 Breaks after PP1 and direct object Because “natural prosody” is likely to be less often produced in Reading 1 than in a Reading 2, it’s important to consider the prosodic patterns for the two readings independently. The prevalence of PP1 breaks for each condition in Reading 1 and Reading 2 recordings is described in table . Table 4.3: PP1 break by condition and reading Reading 1 Reading 2 D Q D Q -GP 84 (68.3%) 84 (68.3%) 84 (68.3%) 83 (66.9%) +GP 122 (99.2%) 119 (99.2%) 121 (99.2%) 117 (97.5%) Table 4.4: OBJ break by condition and reading Reading 1 Reading 2 D Q D Q -GP 95 (77.2%) 94 (76.4%) 104 (84.6%) 90 (72.6%) +GP 71 (57.7%) 68 (56.7%) 89 (73.0%) 89 (74.2%) The primary difference across Readings is in the OBJ break distribution. 4.2.0.2 PP1 and object breaks combined It is perhaps more interesting to look at the combined distribution of the breaks: i.e., a sentence can have one of four patterns: OBJ and PP1 breaks are present; only OBJ or only PP1 is present; or neither is present. As mentioned earlier, there were only 5 cases where neither are present, and those are excluded. Table 4.5: Breaks (%) by condition Reading 1 Reading 2 Non-garden path Garden path Non-garden path Garden path D Q D Q D Q D Q Both 54.1 43.0 72.1 71.7 54.1 43.0 72.1 71.7 OBJ only 31.1 31.4 0.8 2.5 31.1 31.4 0.8 2.5 PP1 only 14.8 25.6 27.0 25.8 14.8 25.6 27.0 25.8 Table shows that for +GP sentences, there are very few instances with the OBJ-only pattern (0.8% in declaratives, 2.5% in interrogatives); whereas that pattern is fairly robust for -GP sentences (31.1% in declaratives, 31.4% in interrogatives). The pattern with both breaks is somewhat more common for +GP sentences (72.1% in declaratives, 71.7% in interrogatives) than -GP (54.1% in declaratives, 43.0% in interrogatives). The PP1-only pattern occurs at about the same rate in +GP interrogatives (25.8%) as in -GP interrogatives (25.6%) and +GP declaratives (27%), but is noticeably less common for -GP declaratives (14.8%). 4.2.0.3 PP1 and object breaks and their relative prominence Table presents data similar to those in the previous section, but it incorporates the rater’s judgement of the relative prominence of the breaks. The &gt; symbol indicates that the rater found the break on the left of that symbol to be stronger, or more prominent, than the break on the left. When no symbol is shown between the two breaks, the rather found them to be of equal prominence. Please be aware that inter-rater reliability for relative prominence was not good, as discussed in section . Table 4.6: Prosodic pattern type by condition and reading Reading 1 Reading 2 Pattern D -GP D +GP Q -GP Q +GP D -GP D +GP Q -GP Q +GP OBJ 31.1 0.8 30.6 2.5 31.1 0.8 30.6 2.5 OBJ &gt; PP1 32.0 23.0 29.8 14.2 32.0 23.0 29.8 14.2 OBJ PP1 5.7 3.3 1.7 4.2 5.7 3.3 1.7 4.2 PP1 &gt; OBJ 16.4 46.7 13.2 53.3 16.4 46.7 13.2 53.3 PP1 14.8 26.2 24.8 25.8 14.8 26.2 24.8 25.8 Another way of looking at these same data is to think of a recording as being PP1-dominant (i.e., PP1 is the only or the strongest break), OBJ-dominate, or neither. This categorization is useful because it creates binary outcomes that can be subjected to logistic regression analyses. The frequency of these patterns is reported in table . Table 4.7: Break dominance (%) by condition PP1 OBJ Reading 1 Reading 2 Reading 1 Reading 2 Not dominant Dominant Not dominant Dominant Not dominant Dominant Not dominant Dominant D -GP 59.3 40.7 69.1 30.9 43.9 56.1 37.4 62.6 D +GP 21.1 78.9 27.0 73.0 85.4 14.6 76.2 23.8 Q -GP 59.3 40.7 62.9 37.1 44.7 55.3 41.1 58.9 Q +GP 12.5 87.5 20.8 79.2 89.2 10.8 83.3 16.7 4.2.1 Regression models predicting break occurence Models predicting the PP1 break and the object break are presented in table . No random slopes were included, as models with random slopes did not converge. For all models in this section, the intercept represents the declarative, non-garden path case. Where Reading is included as a factor, the intercept represents Reading 1. Reading is a statistically siginficant predictor for three of the four models shown in table . Models which exclude Reading 1 are shown in , as these data are more likely to represent true prosodic breaks, or the intended prosody of the reader, rather than mistakes or hesitations. For the models over only Reading 2, the one predicting the presence of a PP1 break failed to converge. tabular_environment(“tabular”) Note that the model predicting the presence of the PP1 break failed to converg, and so is omitted from the Reading 2 only models. TODO Models that exclude the interaction term and that exclude Q vs D as predictor 4.3 Inter-reading time (IRT) This document examines the inter-reading time (IRT) from the study. IRT was measured over 489 recordings: 32 participants, 48 items = 0 recording pairs (reading 1 and reading 2), with -489 missing pairs. The missing data are a result of one or both recordings from a pair being unusable due to technical issues (e.g. a failure of recording equipment, or participant error). 4.3.0.1 Distribution of IRT and data clean-up The raw IRTs for experimental items, before any outliers are trimmed, are distributed as in figure . Overall mean IRT of these data (n = 1494), is 6.5s. The longest is 24.5s and the shortest 429ms. Median IRT is 5.9s. Figure 4.1: Distribution of raw IRT IRTs below 250ms (2) and above 25s (5) are assumed to be implausible and omitted. Experimental data were then Winsorized by participant to bring data in the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of data to the value at those tresholds. The resulting measure is referred to as wIRT and is distribued as shown in Figure (n = 489). Overall mean for wIRT is 6.5s. The longest wIRT is 22.2s and the shortest is 709ms. Median wIRT is 6.1s. Figure 4.2: Distribution of wIRT 4.3.0.2 Means by condition Table shows the mean wIRT by experimental condition. The top left cell represents the mean wIRT for the declaritive controls (“D -GP”). The bottom row shows the increase in IRT across the garden path condition. Table 4.8: Means (s) by condition Condition D Q -GP 6.20 6.47 +GP 6.61 6.85 Increase 0.41 0.37 The difference in the effect of ±GP across ±Q is 0.04s. That is, the mean amount that IRT increased for a garden path declarative compared to a non-garden path declarative is 0.04s more than the amount that IRT increased for a garden path interrogative compared to a non-garden path interrogative. Figure 4.3: Mean IRT by condition 4.3.0.3 Regression models of IRT The models with random slopes for participant and item did not converge, so the tables in this section show models with no random slopes. For the first model, fixed effects of ±GP and ±Q as well is the interaction between them were included, along with random effects of participant and item. The second model removes the interaction, but keeps both main effects. A model with no fixed effects and one with no random effects were also run. The estimates from these models can be seen in table . Several model comparisons were made, seen in tables , , and .

These measures are referred to as the “declarative GP effect” and “interrogative GP effect” in . The difference between the declarative GP effect from the interrogative GP effect is labeled the “difference in effect.” We can see that for 2 of the 4 verbs (set and stick), there was a positive difference in effect, while for the other two we find a negative one.

Mehler 1963, @qp2). The filler sentences in this study were designed so as to provide a diagnostic of the interrogative effect on IRT. The mean IRT for interrogative fillers was 6.2s; for declarative, 6.6s. Interrogatives elicited a mean IRT of 0.4s longer than declaratives. Half of the fillers had a string of two PPs at the end (+PP), and the other half had no trailing PPs (-PP). This did not impact IRT to the same degree (a difference of 0.02s across ±PP). When we look at -PP only, the impact of interrogativty on mean IRT is 0.3s, and for only +PP it’s 0.4s. A mixed effects regression model (no random slope structure, due to convergence errors) found a significant main effect of ±Q (estimate = 0.38s, t = 2.24, p &lt; 0.05), but not for ±PP or the interaction of interrogativity with ±PP. 4.4 Delay comparison for cold vs. previewed readings A comparison of the delay for cold readings compared with that of previewed readings can lend insight into the extent to which subjects followed task instructions. “Delay” here is the amount of time after the start of a recording until the beginning of phonation of the target sentence. Cold readings are also called “reading 1”, while previewed readings are the same as “reading 2”. Implausible delays of &gt;15s are excluded in the data shown here.

["reading-1-delay-category.html", "5 Reading 1 delay category", " 5 Reading 1 delay category Reading 1 (R1) delay is the amount of time between the initial display of a sentence and the start of phonation. Participants’ median R1 delay ranged from 0.60s to 1.60s with a standard deviation of 0.25s. As a way of analyzing the protocol, and the extent to which participants performed as expected, participants were categorized based on their median R1 delay. In what follows, a fast median R1 delay is shorter than or equal to 0.90s, and a slow one is longer than 1.05s, resulting in 12 participants per category. Ten other participants categorized as “normal” and ignored. The distribution of participants across categories is shown in table . These calculations were done over Reading 1 of experimental items (n = 489, with 23 missing items).

["discussion.html", "6 Discussion 6.1 The hypotheses 6.2 Behavioral evidence for the intuition 6.3 Explaining the intuition 6.4 Confounds 6.5 Areas for further study", " 6 Discussion This section will go through the motivating questions behind this study and discuss the extent to which those questions are answered, or not. It will discuss the issues that may have lead to some results that were disatisfying and how to correc them for futuer work. It will then go on to present further questions and propose further studies to explore those new questions and the ones left unanswered here. 6.1 The hypotheses TODO Go over each hypothesis and discuss its support or lack thereof from the data Hypothesis 1 High attachment of PP2 is prosodically marked by a boundary tone between PP1 and and PP2. Hypothesis 2 A cold reading (no preview) of a GP sentence will exhibit less natural prosody (more hesitation at and after the disambiguating region) than: A cold reading of a non-GP sentence. A previewed reading of a GP sentence. Hypothesis 3 A cold reading of a garden-path sentence will more often be produced with prosodic structure that represents an implausible or ungrammatical parse of the string (low attachment of PP2), whereas a previewed reading sentence will more often be pronounced with the prosodic structure that represents the intended parse (high attachment of PP2). Hypothesis 4 A cold reading (no preview) of a declarative GP sentence will exhibit less natural prosody (more hesitation at and after the disambiguating region) and be more likely to be produced with prosodic structure that represents an implausible or ungrammatical parse of the string than a cold reading of an interrogative GP sentence. 6.2 Behavioral evidence for the intuition Ultimately the data here are unable to provide a clear answer to whether or not IRT represents a behavioral correlate of the intuition that PP-attachment garden paths are rendered easier to parse when presented as polar questions. While the mean IRT by condition shows a difference of 0.04s in the direction predicted by the intuition, this is a rather small difference when the grand mean is 6.6s. Mixed-effect regression analyses were not able to detect stastical significance of the interaction between interogativity and ±GP. That said, it was also not clear that a model without the interaction was a better fit than one with it (Full model AIC = 9103.5; Non-interaction model AIC = 9101.6; Χ2 = 0.0352; p &gt; 0.8). Ultimately, it seems likely that the size of the effect, if any, is simply too small to be detected without a huge amount of data. This does not, of course, negate the intuition; it simply means that we have not yet found a behavior that can be said with any certainty to correspond to that intuition. There are a number of issues that might be preventing the observation of behavior that confirms the intuition, and there are also possible explanations for why the intuition might exist without a behavior correlate. These issues are discussed in subsection . 6.3 Explaining the intuition A possible explanation for the intuitive effect of interogativity on parsing garden paths is provided in the work by Bader (1998). Bader demonstrates that it is easier to recover a parse that “behave[s] alike prosodically” to a given failed parse, because the reanalysis does not require prosodic reconstruction and only the syntax needs to be repaired. In the case of the intuition this study is concerned with, this would mean that should sentences be more similar across the garden path vs. non-garden path condition in the interrogative than in the declarative, the intuitive reduction in difficulty of reanalysis would naturally follow. While the data presented above do not definitively show that the prosodic structure of questions is less different for questions than it is for declaratives, it also does not rule it out. Because there does not appear to be a one-to-one mapping of prosodic structure to syntactic structure in the recordings, one cannot make a clear-cut declaration of what a given sentence type looks like prosodically. Instead, we must observe the percentage of recordings for each version of the sentences that exhibit a given pattern. Recall table , repeated here as for convenience. Table 6.1: Combined breaks % per condition in reading 2 only Non-garden path Garden path D Q D Q Both 54.1 43.0 72.1 71.7 OBJ 31.1 31.4 0.8 2.5 PP1 14.8 25.6 27.0 25.8 While there is a larger drop in the number of utterances with both breaks from +GP to -GP for questions than for decaratives, the opposite is true for the pattern with a PP1 break by itself. There is an argument to be made that the OBJ break, which does not correspond to a change in syntactic branching direction for any version of the sentences, is a hesitation rather than a break, due to a moment of confusion or perhaps simply a need to breathe. QUESTION FOR DCB/JDF: Should I include trees here to show the branching direction change? To be more explicit, for this explanation to work, the prosodic structures in 34 and 35 would likely be the ones considered “correct” or most common for a the declarative versions. The symbol “||” is being used to represent a prominent prosodic break. D+GP: He had crammed [OBJ the newspapers] [PP1 under the sofa] || [PP2 into the trashcan]. D-GP: He had crammed [OBJ the newspapers] under the sofa in the guestroom. The prosodic structure of 35 does not mandate any major break, because there is no change in syntactic branching directory and no other reason to mandate a break there. That is, the PP1 break differentiates the two syntactic structures and signals the attachment site of PP2. For the interrogatives, though, this contrast is obscured by the need to apply a rising prosodic contour over the final nuclear accent in the sentence: i.e. PP2, resulting in not a change in syntactic branching direction, but a tonal change, which might sound very similar to a prosodic break. The symbol “//” indicates the start of the rising contour. Q+GP: Had he crammed [OBJ the newspapers] [PP1 under the sofa] ||+// [PP2 into the trashcan]? Q-GP: Had he crammed [OBJ the newspapers] [PP1 under the sofa] // [PP2 in the guestroom]? The critical issue here is that in (37), the absence of a syntactically-motivated break is hidden by the juncture created by the start of the final-rising contour of a question. If the PP1 break is treated as the main indicator of the prosodic structure, then the larger difference across ±GP for declaratives (12.2%) than for interrogatives (0.2%) does indeed, though perhaps weakly, leave open the door for the Bader (1998) style explanation of the intuition. 6.4 Confounds A major roadblock to the success of the methodology here reported is that the region of the sentence where the critical prosodic difference between +GP and -GP sentences lies is the same region where disambiguation occurs for the +GP sentences. Some weaknesses in the data as they are leave need for future studies and methodological improvements. A major issue is the difficulty in differentiating between “true” prosodic breaks and hesitations or breathing pauses. As table (tab:combobr) and the reliability data reported earlier in this paper illustrates, a linguistically trained judge will not necessarily be able to distinguish between prosodic breaks and hesitations, and will not necessarily agree with another linguistically trained judge on the relative prominence of breaks and hesitations within a recording. TODO Expand discussion of hesitation vs. true prosodic break Discuss further issues, e.g. * Over disambiguation (into, onto) * Disregard of instructions (naivety of procedure) * Ways to improve for a similar future study * Follow-up task to check understanding and interpretation of the sentence * Improve IRT accuracy by anticipating the participant’s desire to study slide 1 and either forcing it to disappear or else assuming that to be their study time. 6.5 Areas for further study The study just reported has not provided adequately convincing evidence that the inuition can or can not be explained entirely by the prosodic differences between questions and declaratives. Look at the same phenomenon in embedded questions vs. embedded declarative clauses, where prosody would not be at play. For example: Q +GP: He asked her if she crammed the old newspapers under the couch in the wastebasket. Q -GP: He asked her if she crammed the old newspapers under the couch in the guestroom. D +GP: She told him that she crammed the old newspapers under the couch in the wastebasket. D -GP: She told him that she crammed the old newspapers under the couch in the guestroom. These stimuli could be used in a behavioral (e.g. IRT-based), ERP or eye-tracking based study. ERP-based study: check for Closure Positive Shift (CPS) at PP attachment sites; check for P600/N400 at site of disambiguation. CPS should reveal the tree being parsed for each condition; higher frequency and larger amplitude of P600/N400 across the GP condition in declaratives vs. interrogatives would illustrate the intuitive observation. Eye-tracking: more regressions and longer reading time across the GP condition in declaratives vs. interrogatives would illustrate the intuitive observation. "],
["conclusion.html", "7 Conclusion", " 7 Conclusion TODO Expand on the below Behavioral correlate of the intuition still might exist in IRT, but it remains to be fully supported (more data). Other possibilities exist (eye-tracking, ERP). An explanation for the intuition still in the air, but the data seem to lean towards a non-prosodic account. Prosody-controlled embedded question work is the best next step. Other interesting findings: interrogativity has a robust impact on IRT. Garden path condition has a robust impact on prosodic pattern.

["instr.html", "D Instructions to participants", " D Instructions to participants Thank you kindly for your participation. In this study, you are being asked to read complex sentences out loud, twice each. It is very important that you follow these guidelines for each of your readings. First reading: Begin reading immediately, without giving yourself a chance to look ahead. Imagine you are a television reporter reading an urgent update from a teleprompter. You must be as quick as possible, without taking any time to read ahead. You want to sound natural if you can, but it is more important to not delay. These sentences are complicated and potentially confusing. It’s very important that you read the sentence out loud as soon as it appears. It’s OK if you make mistakes or don’t understand, that is an important part of what I want to know. Do the best you can, and remember you have another chance to read it. Second reading: This time you have the luxury of pacing yourself as you please. Imagine you are providing a voice-over for a documentary. You want to sound conversational and clear, without being overly dramatic or formal. Study the sentence as long as you like, and be sure that you understand it before you begin reading. It is most important to sound natural, without worrying about how long it takes to prepare. The experiment will begin with brief instructions, recapping what you are reading now. There will then be a practice session to get you comfortable with the task and a chance for you to ask any questions you have. Finally, after your questions are answered, the study will begin in earnest. Each sentence will follow the same pattern. You will be presented with a screen which displays a series of plus signs. This indicates that the system is ready and that you should press the button labeled “START” when you are ready to read a sentence. As soon as you press the button, the sentence will appear and you should begin your first reading. After you have completed the reading, press the button labeled “NEXT.” You should allow a small amount of time after you finish and before you hit “NEXT,” to ensure that the recording is not cut off too early. Once you have pressed “NEXT,” you will see a brief instructions slide to help you keep track of where you are. You should then press “START” and begin preparing to read the second time. The background color will change to confirm that the computer has registered your key press. Once you’re ready, read the sentence aloud for the second time and then press “DONE.” Once again, be sure not to cut yourself off. Wait a moment after you finish reading before pressing “DONE.” You are not being judged or measured in any way. Rather, we are interested in how these sentences are pronounced by native speakers of English. Any confusion you have or mistakes you make are interesting properties of the sentences, not failings of you, the speaker. The keys used during the experiment are clearly labeled, but the function of each key is listed below for your reference. There is no hurry for pressing the keys. The only timing of importance is that you begin reading as quickly as possible after pressing “START.” The task should take no longer than one hour The instruction also contained a table (table D.1) which described the purpose and position of the relevant buttons on the keyboard. A separate page with just this table was also provided, and participants were allowed to keep the instructions with them during the entire procedure. Table D.1: Table of keyboard mappings Label Position Description Start Left shift Revewal a sentence and begin your reading. Next Right shift End your first reading. Done Thumb pad End your second reading and prepare for the next sentence. "],
["RA.html", "E Instructions to RA", " E Instructions to RA Before you begin describing the recordings for a given speaker, please familiarize yourself with that speaker. To do so, please listen to recordings numbered 46-48 and 24-27. Next, move on to describings the recordings numbered 1-16. Please listen to them in the following pattern: begin with either 1Y or 1X, and listen to the recordings sequentially (or reverse sequentially), and alternate between X and Y versions. Then, repeat the process for the inverse versions (X vs. Y). Please then listen to the next speaker, beginning with 16X or Y, and then listen in reverse sequence, alternating X vs. Y, and then again repeat for the other half. In this way, please alternate across speakers between listening to X or Y first as well as 1 or 16 first. For each recording, please respond in the spreadsheet using the following guidelines for the columns. Each recording should get its own row. Speaker ID: This should be the name of the directory in which the recording exists. Recording ID: This should be the filename of the recording being described X or Y: This should be the last character of the filename, either X or Y. First recording for speaker: This should indicate which recording you started with first, which will allow me to deduce the pattern you used to listened to the recordings, per above, e.g. 1X, 1Y, 16X or 16Y. For columns E-K, Consider a given sentence to be divided into regions, as in the following example: Table 3.3: Sentence region labels SUBJ V OBJ PP1 PP2 He had meant to stick ||\\(_V\\) the pencil case ||\\(_{OBJ}\\) in the cabinet ||\\(_{PP1}\\) into his book bag. NP\\(_{SUBJ}\\) AUX V\\(_1\\) V\\(_2\\) NP\\(_{OBJ}\\) PP\\(_1\\) PP\\(_2\\) Please work with the assumption that “prosodic boundary” in what follows is any subset of the following features, clustered in such a way as to trigger your intuition that a new prosodic element (of any size) is beginning: pitch change, volume change, segmental lengthening, or pause. Break after V?: Please indicate whether or not you think there is a prosodic boundary after the verb cluster(at the right edge of the last/main verb). Break after OBJ?: Please indicate whether or not you think there is a prosodic boundary after the first NP in the object region (at the right edge of the first NP in the object region). Break after PP1?: Please indicate whether or not you think there is a prosodic boundary after the first NP in the PP1 region (at the right edge of the first NP in the PP region). Strongest break? Please indicate which of the breaks (columns E-G where you indicated YES) you think is strongest. If two breaks are of equal strength and are stronger than a third, indicate NONE as strongest. If two breaks are of equal strength and are weaker than a third, indicate that third break as strongest. If all breaks are the same strength, indicate NONE as strongest. Weakest break? Please indicate which of the breaks (columns E-G where you indicated YES) you think is weakest. If two breaks are of equal strength and are weaker than a third, indicate NONE as weakest. If two breaks are of equal strength and are stronger than a third, indicate that third break as weakest. If all breaks are the same strength, indicate NONE as weakest Struggle?: Indicate whether or not the speaker appears to have had difficulty reading the sentence. This should be relative to their baseline reading fluency, so if a person is hesitant every time, hesitance should not be enough to indicate a struggle. Start of struggle: indicate the region in which you first notice the speaker struggling. *Question?: indicate simply whether or not the recording sounds like a question, prosodically (e.g. final rise is present).
