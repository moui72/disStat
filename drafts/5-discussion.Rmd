# General discussion

This chapter will review the questions motivating this study and discuss the extent to which those questions are answered, or not. It will then go on to develop further questions, and propose further studies to explore those new questions and the ones left unanswered here. Finally, it will summarize the findings and the current standing of this area of research.

Recall that the primary motivation for this study was the possibility that PP-attachment garden paths are easier to understand for speakers of American English when presented in the interrogative, as opposed to the declarative. In Section \@ref(obs), a distinction was made between the intuition first outlined in @qp2 and the current hypothesis. For terminological clarity, this chapter will make use of the following definitions:

  (@intu) *The Intuition:* Certain pragmatically disambiguated prepositional phrase (PP) attachment ambiguities which are difficult to parse in the declarative are less difficult to parse when presented as yes-no interrogatives (e.g., Jed crammed the newspapers under the sofa in the trashcan).
  
  (@hypo) *The current hypothesis:* The *Intuition* may be extensible to PP attachment ambiguities that are syntactically disambiguated in addition to those that are pragmatically disambiguated (e.g., Had he planned to cram the paperwork [~PP1~ in the drawer] [~PP2~ into his briefcase]?).

The goal of this study was to establish whether there is evidence for (@hypo), and to explore the implications of those findings for possible explainations of (@intu).

## Behavioral correlate for the intuition

Ultimately, no evidence has been found to support the current hypothesis, that the intuition can be extended to syntactically disambiguated sentences. Mixed-effect regression analyses were not able to detect statistical significance for the interaction between Speech Act and PP2 Status. This does not, of course, negate the intuition; it simply means that we have not yet found a behavior that can be said with certainty to correspond to that intuition. Future research should pursue the possibility that IRT is not the ideal measure for detecting any behavioral correlate of the processing difference for PP-attachment garden paths between interrogatives and declaratives.

## On explanations for the intuition

This section looks at the evidence for and against some of the possible explanations for the intuition reported in @qp2.

### A prosodic account

The prosodic phrasings produced by participants in this study varied systematically by PP2 Status. This is an interesting finding in and of itself, adding to the growing literature that shows a link between syntactic structure and prosodic phrasing.A possible explanation for the intuitive effect of interogativity on parsing garden paths is provided in the work by @Bader1998-ts. Bader demonstrates that it is easier to recover a parse that “behave[s] alike prosodically” to a given failed parse, because the reanalysis does not require prosodic reconstruction and only the syntax needs to be repaired. In the case of the intuition this study is concerned with, this would mean that if sentences were more similar across the Arg vs. Mod PP2 Status in the interrogative than in the declarative, the intuitive reduction in difficulty of reanalysis would naturally follow. 

The findings of this study show that there is no one-to-one mapping between prosodic structure and the four sentence types defined by the design of the study (Q Arg, D Arg, Q Mod, D Mod). Rather, there are gradient differences in occurence for each pattern for a given sentence type. Table \@ref(tab:combobr) shows the distribution of the possible simple break patterns (PP2 break only, OBJ break only, or both breaks, with the negligible number of cases of neither break omitted) as a function of sentence type for Reading 2 only.

```{r combobr}
kable(ccombo,caption="Percent occurrence of simple break patterns in Reading 2 as a function of sentence type.", col.names=c("D","Q","D","Q"),align="c") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" "=1,"Mod" = 2, "Arg"=2)) %>%
  column_spec(1,bold=T) %>% kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

While there is a larger drop in the number of utterances with both breaks from +GP to -GP for questions than for declaratives, the opposite is true for the pattern with a PP1 break by itself. There is an argument to be made that the OBJ break, which does not correspond to a change in syntactic branching direction for any version of the sentences, is a hesitation rather than a break, due to a moment of confusion or perhaps simply a need to breathe. 

To be more explicit, for this explanation to work, the prosodic structures in @dlo and @dhi would likely be the ones considered "correct" or most common for a the declarative versions. The symbol "%" is being used to represent a prominent prosodic break.

  (@dlo) *D+GP*: He had crammed [~OBJ~ the newspapers] [~PP1~ under the sofa] % [~PP2~ into the trashcan].
  (@dhi) *D-GP*: He had crammed [~OBJ~ the newspapers] under the sofa in the guestroom.

The prosodic structure of @dhi does not mandate any major break, because there is no change in syntactic branching directory and no other reason to mandate a break there. That is, the PP1 break differentiates the two syntactic structures and signals the attachment site of PP2. 
 
For the interrogatives, though, this contrast is obscured by the need to apply a rising prosodic contour over the final nuclear accent in the sentence: i.e., PP2, resulting in not a change in syntactic branching direction, but the anticipation of a tonal change, which might sound very similar to a prosodic break. The symbol "\uparrow" indicates the start of the rising contour.

  (@qlo) *Q+GP*: Had he crammed [~OBJ~ the newspapers] [~PP1~ under the sofa] % [~PP2~ into the \uparrow trashcan]?
  (@qhi) *Q-GP*: Had he crammed [~OBJ~ the newspapers] [~PP1~ under the sofa] [~PP2~ in the \uparrow guestroom]?

The critical issue here is that in (@qhi), the absence of a syntactically-motivated break might be obscured by the hesitation necessitated by preparing to start the final-rising contour of a question two words later. It's not impossible that the need to make the mechanical preparation necessary to execute a rising contour could result in a hesitation or pause at the preceding syntactic juncture most welcoming to it, the PP1 break position. 

If the PP1 break is treated as the main indicator of the prosodic structure, then the larger difference across PP2 Status for declaratives (`r 27-14.8`%) than for interrogatives (`r 25.8-25.6`%) does, though perhaps weakly, leave open the door for the @Bader1998-ts style explanation of the intuition. Ultimately, though, logistic regression models showed no significant effect of the interaction between Speech Act and PP2 Status, so it is safest to assume that this difference is just noise, and that the explanation for the intuition is not prosodic.

### A processing illusion

Another possibility to consider is that the intuition itself is illusory in nature, i.e., it is not the case that interrogative PP-attachment garden paths (pragmatically or syntactically disambiguated) are easier to parse than declarative ones but only appear to be so. Perhaps the Q Arg sentences are not actually easier to parse, but appear to be, because the added complexity of the interrogative version is distracting the reader with a different sort of difficulty. It may be that  are being distracted by the processing cost of interrogativity, and thereby are less sensitive to the cost of reanalysis. While the parser is struggling with two additive increases to complexity as compared to D Mod sentences (i.e., Arg PP2 Status and interrogative context) the reader is aware only of the more immediately obvious difference, that of interrogativity, and fails to consciously notice the structural reanalysis that the parser is undertaking.

## Conclusions {#confound}

In this section, I will discuss some of the issues with the current study, and what I see as fruitful avenues for future study.

### Double reading and inter-item reading time and the processing cost of interrogativity

While IRT did not detect a behavioral correlate of the motivating intuition for this study, it did show a robust effect of PP2 Status, indicating that it may yet be a useful diagnostic for parsing difficulty. 

The IRT data reported also supported prior findings that interrogatives are slower or more difficult to comprehend than similar declarative sentences.

The fact that reading (Reading 1 vs. Reading 2) frequently had an effect on prosodic phrasing also supports the finding of @fodor2019center that item preview should be tightly controlled when one is studying prosodic structure.

### Future work

Some future studies that could further this line of research are outlined below.

#### Embedded questions

The explanation for the intuition that PP-attachment garden paths are less difficult to parse in interrogatives than in declaratives must either be prosodic, or else semantic/pragmatic. It seems very unlikely that the minor syntactic difference across the two sentence types (i.e., subject-auxiliary inversion) could be the reason for a difference in perceived ease of understanding. It is either the difference in the intonational contour between the two sentences types, or else it is something about the meaning or meta-linguistic difference between interrogatives and declaratives. The study just reported has shown evidence that the intuition can not easily be explained entirely by the prosodic differences between questions and declaratives; the possibility remains weakly at best. It seems that most important next step in explaining the aforementioned intuition would be to look at the same phenomenon in embedded questions vs. embedded declarative clauses, where prosody would not be at play but the semantic/pragmatic differences should remain. For example:

  (@embed_qgp) *EmQ +GP:* He asked her if she had decided to cram the old newspapers under the couch in the wastebasket.
  (@embed_qct) *EmQ -GP:* He asked her if she had decided to cram the old newspapers under the couch in the guestroom.  
  
  (@embed_dgp) *EmD +GP:* She told him that she had decided to cram the old newspapers under the couch in the wastebasket.
  (@embed_dct) *EmD -GP:* She told him that she had decided to cram the old newspapers under the couch in the guestroom.

The prosody of an embedded question, as in (@embed_qgp), does not differ from that of a sentence like (@embed_dgp); but, the semantic properties and some of the pragmatic properties of the embedded clause in (@embed_qgp) are the same as in the Q Arg sentences from the study just reported.

  (@qgp_re) Had she decided to crammed the old newspapers under the couch in the wastebasket?

These stimuli could be used with ERP or eye-tracking methodology to see if parsing difficulty differs across the embedded clause's declarative vs. interrogative nature. If a behavioral correlate of the intuition is found with embedded question stimuli, that would be strong evidence that the explanation is semantic or pragmatic rather than prosodic.

### Hesitations vs. prosodic breaks

An issue with the findings of this study is the difficulty in differentiating between syntactically-motivated prosodic breaks and hesitations. As shown by the reliability data reported in Section \@ref(rel) illustrates, a linguistically trained judge will not necessarily be able to agree where breaks fall and which breaks are stronger, likely in large part because of the difficulty in differentiating between prosodic breaks and hesitations. 

It is famously difficult to instrumentally describe a prosodic break, and there is no guarentee that examining the wave forms instrumentally would fare any better in making this distinction than the intuition of the judges. That said, it may be possible to distinguish the two sorts of breaks: it may be that boundary tones or segmental lengthening are typically not part of a hesitation break, but are a part of hesitation break, for example. No immediately apparent pattern is available, but it would be inordinately beneficial if one could be found.

In \@ref(erp) I propose that an event-related potential paradigm might hold the key for distinguishing between the two.

#### Event-related potential (ERP) study {#erp}

An event-related potential study of the phenomenon could provide a number of useful insights. It has been shown that the so-called closure-positive shift (CPS), an ERP component that is elicited by the presence of a prosodic break or a comma, is present even in silent reading. This has a number of important implications for research on the phenomena at hand. 

For one, it provides a way to distinguish between a hesitation after PP1 and a true prosodic break; which is to say, a way to distinguish between an unencumbered reading with a prosodic break after PP1 and a garden-path effect that, in the study reported here, resulted in a hesitation at that point. An ERP measure time-locked to that position should show a CPS component when the reader successfully incorporates PP1 as a modifier of the object and then changes branching direction to incorporate PP2 as the goal argument; conversely, a reader who is experiencing a garden-path effect at that point should instead or additionally show a P600 component (@p600addscps found that the two components can be additive). If the participant were concurrently recorded reading the sentence aloud, definitive data could be created which could then be used to either train a linguist or perhaps a neural network to distinguish between hesitations (P600s) and prosodic breaks (CPSes). The trained model or linguist could then return to the recordings collect for this study and make definitive judgments regarding the nature of the breaks reported here, and clarify the results of this study.

It would also be useful to see if repeated readings of the same garden-path sentence reduces the P600; if so, is the rate of decay faster for interrogatives than declaratives? Such a phenomenon could be a correlate of the reported intuition.

## Summary

In sum, the current study has not found evidence that supports the extension of the intuition over items that are syntactically disambiguated. It has found an effect on IRT of the garden path effect in both declarative and interrogative cases, and it has found an effect of Speech Act on the IRT for filler items. There are systematic differences in the way that the different sentence types are prosodically structured, but the correspondence between sentence type and prosodic pattern is gradient rather than categorical. It's possible that a Bader-esque account can explain the intuition, or that the intuition is illusory, or that the intuition is due to semantic or pragmatic factors. It is also possible that the intuition simply does not apply to syntactically disambiguated instances of the garden path in question to the extent that it can be detected in the measures reported here. Further study via behavioral, eye-tracking, or ERP methodology are likely to be fruitful in further understanding the phenomenon.
