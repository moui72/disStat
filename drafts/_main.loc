\ChangesListline {added}{Added\nobreakspace {}(TJP)}{The higher relative frequency of PP1 break dominance in Arg sentences compared to Mod sentences is expected, since it represents a linguistically motivated prosodic break in the Arg cases. For the Mod sentences, there is no linguistic motivation for the PP1 break, so it makes sense for it to be less frequent and less dominant in Mod sentences. It is noteworthy and puzzling that the patterns do not differ greatly across the two readings, as one would expect difficulty getting the prosody right on the first try for the difficult sentences being tested in the current study.}{47}

As a result of the reader's increased difficulty in Reading 1 for the recordings in the slow category, the effect of processing difficulty is not limited to Reading 1 but in fact spills over into Reading 2. The slow category represents readers who are never able to fully comprehend the sentence, and thus hesitate more frequently.}{54}
