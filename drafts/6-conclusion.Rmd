Discussion of what is still unknown, and suggestions of future research.

# Issues with the reported study
Statistical significance for the behavioral correlate of the intuition: more participants

## Ways to improve for a similar future study

Follow-up task to check understanding and interpretation of the sentence

Improve IRT accuracy by anticipating the participantâ€™s desire to study slide 1 and either forcing it to disappear or else assuming that to be their study time.

# Fruitful avenues for further study

ERP-based study: check for Closure Positive Shift (CPS) at PP attachment sites; check for P600/N400 at site of disambiguation. CPS should reveal the tree being parsed for each condition; higher frequency and severity of P600/N400 across the GP condition in declaratives vs. interrogatives would illustrate the intuitive observation.

Eye-tracking: more regressions and longer reading time across the GP condition in declaratives vs. interrogatives would illustrate the intuitive observation.
