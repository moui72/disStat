  ABSTRACT={Although eye movements during reading are modulated by cognitive processing demands, they also reflect visual sampling of the input, and possibly preparation of output for speech or the inner voice. By simultaneously recording eye movements and the voice during reading aloud, we obtained an output measure that constrains the length of time spent on cognitive processing. Here we investigate the dynamics of the eye-voice span (EVS), the distance between eye and voice. We show that the EVS is regulated immediately during fixation of a word by either increasing fixation duration or programming a regressive eye movement against the reading direction. EVS size at the beginning of a fixation was positively correlated with the likelihood of regressions and refixations. Regression probability was further increased if the EVS was still large at the end of a fixation: if adjustment of fixation duration did not sufficiently reduce the EVS during a fixation, then a regression rather than a refixation followed with high probability. We further show that the EVS can help understand cognitive influences on fixation duration during reading: in mixed model analyses, the EVS was a stronger predictor of fixation durations than either word frequency or word length. The EVS modulated the influence of several other predictors on single fixation durations. For example, word-N frequency effects were larger with a large EVS, especially when word N-1 frequency was low. Finally, a comparison of single fixation durations during oral and silent reading showed that reading is governed by similar principles in both reading modes, although EVS maintenance and articulatory processing also cause some differences. In summary, the eye-voice span is regulated by adjusting fixation duration and/or by programming a regressive eye movement when the eye-voice span gets too large. Overall, the EVS appears to be directly related to updating of the working memory buffer during reading.}

               relation to syntax is developed in this book, which is the first
               to address the question of the relation between syntax and
               phonology in a systematic way.This general theory differs from
               its predecessors in the generative tradition in several
               respects. By arguing that the intonational structure of a
               sentence determines certain aspects of its stress pattern or
               rhythmic structure, and not vice versa, it provides a novel view
               of the intonation-stress relation. It also offers a new theory
               of the focus-prosody relation that solves a variety of classic
               puzzles and involves an appeal to the place of a focused
               constituent in the predicate-argument structure of the sentence.
               The book also includes other novel features, among them a
               development of the metrical grid theory of stress (including a
               complete treatment of English word stress in this framework),
               the representation of juncture in terms of ``silent'' positions
               in the metrical grid (with a treatment of sandhi in terms of
               this rhythmic juncture), and a ``rhythmic'' nonsyntactic
               approach to the basic phonology of function words in
               EnglishElisabeth 0. Selkirk is Professor of Linguistics at the
