  abstract  = "A fundamentally new approach to the theory of phonology and its
               relation to syntax is developed in this book, which is the first
               to address the question of the relation between syntax and
               phonology in a systematic way.This general theory differs from
               its predecessors in the generative tradition in several
               respects. By arguing that the intonational structure of a
               sentence determines certain aspects of its stress pattern or
               rhythmic structure, and not vice versa, it provides a novel view
               of the intonation-stress relation. It also offers a new theory
               of the focus-prosody relation that solves a variety of classic
               puzzles and involves an appeal to the place of a focused
               constituent in the predicate-argument structure of the sentence.
               The book also includes other novel features, among them a
               development of the metrical grid theory of stress (including a
               complete treatment of English word stress in this framework),
               the representation of juncture in terms of ``silent'' positions
               in the metrical grid (with a treatment of sandhi in terms of
               this rhythmic juncture), and a ``rhythmic'' nonsyntactic
               approach to the basic phonology of function words in
               EnglishElisabeth 0. Selkirk is Professor of Linguistics at the
