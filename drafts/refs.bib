               relation to syntax is developed in this book, which is the first
               to address the question of the relation between syntax and
               phonology in a systematic way.This general theory differs from
               its predecessors in the generative tradition in several
               respects. By arguing that the intonational structure of a
               sentence determines certain aspects of its stress pattern or
               rhythmic structure, and not vice versa, it provides a novel view
               of the intonation-stress relation. It also offers a new theory
               of the focus-prosody relation that solves a variety of classic
               puzzles and involves an appeal to the place of a focused
               constituent in the predicate-argument structure of the sentence.
               The book also includes other novel features, among them a
               development of the metrical grid theory of stress (including a
               complete treatment of English word stress in this framework),
               the representation of juncture in terms of ``silent'' positions
               in the metrical grid (with a treatment of sandhi in terms of
               this rhythmic juncture), and a ``rhythmic'' nonsyntactic
               approach to the basic phonology of function words in
               EnglishElisabeth 0. Selkirk is Professor of Linguistics at the
