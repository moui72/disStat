# Results

This section reports various descriptions and analyses of the recordings obtained. The reported results include the effect of speech act (declarative/D vs. interrogative/Q) and PP2 status (argument/Arg vs. modifier/Mod) on the location of prosodic breaks, as well as on time spent studying a sentence between readings, which I call inter-reading time (IRT). In order to evaluate the extent to which participants completed the protocol as intended, i.e. began to read immediately for Reading 1 as opposed to producing a studied reading in Reading 2, the delay for which a sentence is displayed before a participant begins to read it is compared for Reading 1  (R1 delay) vs. Reading 2 (R2 delay). The prosodic patterns for participants with especially fast and especially slow R1 delays are presented as a way of investigating the extent to which individual differences might impact those patterns, and as a further exploration of the success of the protocol instructions in producing the intended behavior. An interesting auxiliary finding regarding the effect of speech act in inflating IRT in general (regardless of PP2 status; indeed, even for filler items) is also reported.

## Missing data

There were 32 total participants whose data were analyzed. There were 4 versions of the experiment, and two possible orderings. Ideally there would be 4 participants per version-order combination, but due to participant attrition and issues during data collection, the distribution is as in table \@ref(tab:vtab).

```{r vtab, echo=F}
library(kableExtra)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

kable <- function(...) {
  knitr::kable(booktabs = TRUE,...)
}

mdata <- read_csv("export/prosody_data.csv")

versiontab <- mdata %>% 
  filter(!duplicated(Participant)) %>%
  with(table("Version"=LIST,Order)) %>%
  addmargins() 

rownames(versiontab)[1:4]<-paste("Version", rownames(versiontab))
versiontab %>% kable(
  caption="No. of participants per version-order combination",
  col.names = c("1", "2", "Sum"),
  align="c"
) %>% kable_styling() %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" "=1, "Order"=2, " "=1))
```

Some of the expected 3072 (32 participants x 48 items (16 experimental and 32 filler) x 2 readings each) recordings were missing due to technical issues during data collection, including some of the recordings of experimental items. Data were also excluded if either recording from a pair of recordings (Reading 1 and Reading 2) was missing (there were 9 incomplete pairs excluded) because without the other member, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the protocol was executed as intended (i.e. the extent of preview for Reading 1 vs. Reading 2). 

```{r rvtab, echo=F}
library(tidyr)
tot<-as.data.frame(xtabs( ~ Condition_GP + Condition_Q, data=mdata))
gtot <- tot

totDisp <- gtot %>% as.data.frame() %>%
  spread(Condition_Q,Freq) 
totDisp[[1]] <- c("Mod", "Arg")

kable(
  totDisp,
  col.names=c(" ", "D", "Q"),
  caption="Number of recordings by condition",
  align="c"
) %>% kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position"))
```

Ultimately, 978 experimental item recordings were analyzed for prosody, which equates to 489 Reading 1/Reading 2 pairs (pairs were analyzed for IRT). The distribution of these recordings across the experimental item versions is shown in table \@ref(tab:rvtab).

## Prosodic break patterns

The two positions where the presence or absence of prosodic breaks in the recordings were considered: directly after the direct object of the construction verb (the OBJ break), and directly after PP1 (the PP1 break). The break locations are indicated with a % symbol in (@breakpos).

  (@breakpos) !["... stick the letter % in the mailbox % into the proper stack."](breakpos.png)

The results reported are based on the intuitive judgement of a trained linguist who was naive to the research paradigm being undertaken.

The presence of the OBJ break was more sensitive to both speech act and reading, with Reading 2 showing a different distribution across the D vs. Q distinction than the Reading 1 recordings.

pp1objr1[[1]] <- c("-GP","+GP")

pp1[[1]] <- c("-GP","+GP")

obj<-cbind(r1obj,r2obj[2:3])
obj[[1]] <- c("-GP","+GP")
```

The PP1 break was almost always present for cases where PP2 was an argument; and it was present substantially less often, but still there a majority of the time, for cases where PP2 could be interpreted as a modifier. 

```{r pp1}
kable(
  pp1,
  caption="PP1 break by condition and reading",
  col.names = c("", "D", "Q","D", "Q"),
  align="c"
) %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" "=1,"Reading 1"=2,"Reading 2"=2)) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position"))
```

Speech act and reading did not appear to impact the overall distribution of the PP1 break.

```{r obj}
kable(
  obj,
  caption="OBJ break by condition and reading",
  col.names = c("", "D", "Q","D", "Q"),
  align="c"
) %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" "=1,"Reading 1"=2,"Reading 2"=2)) %>% 
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position"))
```

When looking at both breaks together, a sentence could have one of four patterns: OBJ and PP1 break present; only OBJ or only PP1 present; or neither. As mentioned earlier, there were only 5 cases where neither are present, and those omitted in the tables of prosodic patterns.

bothrbothb <- cbind(ccombo,cccombo)

```

```{r bothbreaks}
kable(bothrbothb,caption="Breaks (%) by condition",align="c") %>%
  add_header_above(c(" "=1,rep(c("Mod" = 2, "Arg"=2),2))) %>%

  column_spec(1,bold=T)%>% kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")

```

Table \@ref(tab:bothbreaks) shows that for Arg sentences, there are very few instances with the OBJ-only pattern (0.8% in declaratives, 2.5% in interrogatives); whereas that pattern is fairly frequent for Mod sentences (31.1% in declaratives, 31.4% in interrogatives). The pattern with both breaks is somewhat more common for Arg sentences (72.1% in declaratives, 71.7% in interrogatives) than Mod (54.1% in declaratives, 43.0% in interrogatives). The PP1-only pattern occurs at about the same rate in Arg interrogatives (25.8%) as in Mod interrogatives (25.6%) and Arg declaratives (27%), but is noticeably less common for Mod declaratives (14.8%). These proportions are visually represented in figure \@ref(fig:bothbreaks).

```{r bothbreaks, fig.cap="Plot of pattern proportions per condition",fig.height=4,fig.pos="H"}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(extrafont)
adata <- mdata
adata$reading <- paste("Reading", adata$Reading)

ggplot(adata,    
    aes(
      x=condition,
      y=..count..,
      fill=reorder(
        simple2lvl,
        ifelse(simple2lvl=="PP1", 1, ifelse(simple2lvl=="OBJ",3,2))
      )
    )) +
  geom_bar(position="fill",color="black",width=0.5) +
  labs(fill="Pattern",x=" ",y=" ") +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(reading)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(breaks=c("PP1", "BOTH", "OBJ"), palette="Greys") +
  theme_tufte(base_size = 12, base_family="Georgia")
```

Another relevant judgement was also collected: the relative strength of the PP1 and OBJ breaks. Figure 2 incorporates this information, where “PP1 dominance” means that the PP1 break was reported to be stronger than the OBJ break; “OBJ” dominance means the opposite; and “Equal strength” means that neither break was reported to be stronger than the other. The 5 instances with no breaks were again omitted.

```{r bdom, fig.cap="Plot of break dominance by condition",fig.height=4,fig.pos="H"}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(extrafont)
adata <- mdata
adata$reading <- paste("Reading", adata$Reading)

ggplot(adata,    
    aes(
      x=condition,
      y=..count..,
      fill=reorder(
        dom,
        ifelse(simple2lvl=="PP1 dominant", 1, ifelse(simple2lvl=="OBJ dominant",3,2))
      )
    )) +
  geom_bar(position="fill",color="black",width=0.5) +
  labs(fill="Pattern",x=" ",y=" ") +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(reading)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(breaks=c("PP1 dominant", "Equal strength", "OBJ dominant"), palette="Greys") +
  theme_tufte(base_size = 12, base_family="Georgia")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:bdom) clearly shows a robust effect of PP2 status on break dominance, and little to no impact of reading or speech act.

### Regression models of prosodic break patterns

A number of mixed effects logistic regression models support the general observations above. Models predicting PP1 break, OBJ break, PP1 break dominance and OBJ break dominance are reported. All models include crossed random effect intercepts (participant and item), but due to convergence errors, no random slopes are included. The intercept always represents the D Mod (“control”) condition. In each case, models were selected from a set of models by selecting the one with the lowest reported AIC. Model comparisons did not always find significant differences between the more complex models. In each case, the selected model was compared to a minimal model where the fixed effects structure was simply a dummy value of 1, and all reported models represent improvement over the minimal model to a statistically significant degree. That comparison is reported for each model.

```{r objMod}
csv <- 'Outcome: OBJ break,Estimate,Std. Error,p
"D Mod, Reading 1 (Intercept)",1.39,0.45,< 0.01
Reading 2,0.11,0.23,0.62
Arg,-1.98,0.5,< 0.001
Reading 2 : Arg,0.81,0.32,< 0.05'

tab <- read_csv(csv)

tab %>% kable(
  align="rccc", 
  caption="Mixed effects logistic regression model predicting OBJ break occurrence"
) %>% 
  row_spec(0,align="c") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

Table \@ref(tab:objMod) shows a model predicting the occurrence of an OBJ break with estimates for the coefficients of the fixed effects of Reading 2, PP2 and the interaction between Reading and PP2 status. A comparison between the reported model and a minimal one with a dummy value of 1 as the only fixed effect found that the reported model was better with a high level of confidence (AIC~MIN~=1068.0, AIC~BEST~=1031.6, 𝜒2(2)=30.5, p < 0.001).

```{r pp1Mod}
csv <- '
Outcome: PP1 break,Estimate,Std. Error,p
"D Mod, Reading 1 (Intercept)",0.96,0.3,< 0.01
Arg,4.12,0.44,< 0.001
'

tab <- read_csv(csv)

tab %>% kable(
  align="rccc",
  caption="Mixed effects logistic regression model predicting PP1 break occurrence"
) %>% 
  row_spec(0,align="c") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

Sentences with argument PP2s had greatly increased log odds of a PP1 break compared to ones with modifier PP2s (β=4.12, std. error = 0.44, p < 0.001).
	Models were also run for predicting break dominance. Table \@ref(tab:odom) reports the best model for predicting OBJ break dominance. The best model was one with fixed effects for reading and PP2 status. There was no statistically significant effect of speech act on OBJ break dominance.

```{r odom}
csv <- '
Outcome: OBJ dominance,Estimate,Std. Error,p
"D Mod, Reading 1 (Intercept)",-0.16,0.32,0.62
Reading 2,0.4,0.16,< 0.05
Arg,-2.32,0.18,< 0.001
'

tab <- read_csv(csv)

tab %>% kable(
  align="rccc",
  caption="Mixed effects logistic regression model predicting OBJ break dominance"
) %>% 
  row_spec(0,align="c") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```

Table \@ref(tab:pdom) reports the best model for predicting PP1 break dominance. Unlike the model for predicting OBJ break dominance, the best model for predicting PP1 break dominance includes speech act as a predictor. The best model is one with fixed effects for reading, speech act, and PP2 status.

```{r pdom}
csv <- '
Outcome: PP1 dominance,Estimate,Std. Error,p
"D Mod, Reading 1 (Intercept)",-0.19,0.33,0.57
Reading 2,-0.38,0.15,< 0.05
Q,0.31,0.15,< 0.05
Arg,2.2,0.17,< 0.001
'

tab <- read_csv(csv)

tab %>% kable(
  align="rccc",
  caption="Mixed effects logistic regression model predicting PP1 break dominance"
) %>% 
  row_spec(0,align="c") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```
This model was better than a minimal model  (AIC~MIN~=1290.4, AIC~BEST~=1078.8, &chi;^2^2(3)=217.59, p < 0.001). PP1 break dominance was much more likely for sentence with argument PP2s than sentences with modifier PP2s, with interrogatives having slightly increased log odds of PP1 break dominance. Log odds of PP1 break dominance were slightly less in Reading 2 than Reading 1.

Because reading was a significant predictor for 3 of the 4 models reported, and there are theoretical reasons to believe that Reading 2 is more representative of the natural or intended prosody of the reader, models were also run predicting PP1 dominance and OBJ dominance for Reading 2 data only. In both cases, the best model had the same structure: fixed effects of speech act and PP2 status, with no interaction term.


```{r r2dom}
csv <- '
,Estimate,Std. Err,p,Estimate,Std. Err,p
D Mod (Intercept),0.66,0.24,< 0.01,-0.97,0.27,< 0.001
Q,-0.3,0.22,0.16,0.35,0.22,0.1
Arg,-2.07,0.24,< 0.001,2.15,0.24,< 0.001
'

tab <- read_csv(csv)

tab %>% kable(
  col.names=c("(Reading 2 only)","Estimate","Std. Err","p","Estimate","Std. Err","p"),
  align="rccc",  caption="Mixed effects logistic regression models predicting break dominance in Reading 2"
) %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" "=1, "Outcome: OBJ Dominance" = 3, "Outcome: PP1 Dominance" = 3)) %>%
  row_spec(0,align="c") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "hold_position")
```
