 This paper presents a study on human sentence processing, or parsing, and on the parsing of a particular sort of ambiguity. Parsing is assumed to be the projection of structure by a reader or listener over a string (which obviously lacks inherent structure). Following the sort of model of parsing put forward by, e.g., @kimball1973seven, @frazier1978sausage, and @frazier1996construal, this study assumes that parsing is done online and that most material must be incorporated into the structure being built as soon as it is encountered. This can lead to mis-parses, where the parser has guessed wrong about how to incorporate a given phrase with a temporarily ambiguous structure, and then encounters material that cannot be incorporated into the current structure. When this happens, the parser must \replaced{reanalyze the material that had so far been processed, in order to come upa structure that can accomodate both the new and old material grammatically}{discard part or all of its pending structure and try again to incorporate the material encountered so far}. This sort of parser crash is \deleted[id=JDF]{often} called a garden path.

 \deleted{PP1, *in the drawer*, is the same in both (@pp2t a) and (@pp2t b), and is ambiguous on first encounter, as it could modify the paperwork or it could be the goal of cram. In (@pp2t a), however, PP2 must ultimately be interpreted as the goal of the verb *cram* because *into his briefcase* cannot modify *the drawer*. Because *cram* only accepts one goal, this means that PP1 in (@pp2t a) has to end up as a modifier of *the paperwork*.  In (@pp2t b), on the other hand, PP2 *of his filing cabinet* can (in this case, must) modify *the drawer*, and so in the drawer can and does end up as the goal of cram. The difference in PP2 Status between (@pp2t a) and (@pp2t b) results in different structures, which I argue are reached by different parsing mechanisms. Namely, (@pp2t a) should, by hypothesis, result in a parse which initially incorporates PP1 as the goal argument of *cram* but then fails and triggers reanalysis when PP2 is encountered. Conversely, (@pp2t b) should by hypothesis allow a straightforward parse where PP1 is initially and ultimately slotted in as the goal of *cram*, since PP2 poses no issue when interpreted as a modifier of *the drawer*. This means (@pp2t b) should not trigger reanalysis. Where (@pp2t a) is a so-called garden path sentence, (@pp2t b) is not. In what follows, I will use the term "argument attachment of PP2" to mean the garden path case, i.e., a sentence that is presumed to require reanalysis, and "modifier attachment of PP2" to mean the straightforwardly parsed case where PP1 is the goal argument.}

\deleted{PP1, *in the drawer*, is the same in both (@pp2t a) and (@pp2t b), and is ambiguous on first encounter, as it could modify the paperwork or it could be the goal of cram. In (@pp2t a), however, PP2 must ultimately be interpreted as the goal of the verb *cram* because *into his briefcase* cannot modify *the drawer*. Because *cram* only accepts one goal, this means that PP1 in (@pp2t a) has to end up as a modifier of *the paperwork*.  In (@pp2t b), on the other hand, PP2 *of his filing cabinet* can (in this case, must) modify *the drawer*, and so in the drawer can and does end up as the goal of cram.

Fodor leverages this in order to explain the difference in RC attachment site tendency between languages.

This difference in prosodic tendency, in turn, can be explained using a constraints-based approach. Consider Selkirk's [-@Selkirk1986-hc] alignment constraints:

 Essentially, @Selkirk1986-hc argues that relative ranking of alignment constraints for the left edge of phrases (*Align-XP/L*) with those for the right edge of phrases (*Align-XP/R*) can impact the distribution of prosodic breaks. These alignment constraints dictate that the edges of prosodic units (and thus the location of prosodic breaks) should align with the edges of syntactic constituents. Because the prosodic break that encourages high attachment is one which aligns with the left edge of the RC \added[id=JDF]{in examples like} (@servant), postulating that *Align-XP/L* is ranked above *Align-XP/R* in languages like French that prefer high attachment can account for that preference (remember that a prosodic break in that place has been shown to encourage a high attachment interpretation). In languages where low \added[id=JDF]{RC} attachment is preferred, we can assume that *Align-XP/R* is ranked higher, and thus a prosodic break is more likely to occur after the RC than before.
