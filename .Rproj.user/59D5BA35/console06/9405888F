Result: 
RC attachment undergoes association because the relationship between a modifier and whatever is modified is a non-primary relation, and a relative clause is by definition a modifier and not an argument. Circling back to the PP-attachment that this study is concerned with, the argument vs. modifier distinction is precisely what distinguishes the two possible statuses of PP2 shown and illustrated in (@pp2t) and repeated here as (@pp2tr).

 \replaced{I suggest}{The current study proposes} that argument attachment of PP2 will be marked by a prosodic boundary between PP1 and PP2 (for discussion of what constitutes a prosodic boundary, see e.g., @streeter1978acoustic and @salverda2003role). Modifier attachment of PP2, on the other hand, will lack any substantial boundary marking in that position; instead, a break after the object is expected.
